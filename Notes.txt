Preliminary Steps (that I hope are mostly correct):
1. Forked repository from main
2. Cloned repository to directory on my device.
3. Installed 'Rainbow CSV' extension b/c colors are neat

I have some initial thoughts.
let's define pathnames to be of the form pathname/filename.ext where ext is the extension/filetype i.e. it's one of [txt, tsv, xml]
Because we must be able to accept a list of pathnames, I must account for the user to input a list in different ways.
one way is to have the pathnames be separated by a comma and space:
pathname1, pathname2, pathname3
a second way is to separate them by a space:
pathname1 pathname2 pathname3
third, if the user is particularly rude, they may not separate them at all:
pathname1pathname2pathname3
fourth, because this a python script, the user may be inclined to write the input as:
[pathname1, pathname2, pathname3] or ['pathname1', 'pathname2', 'pathname3']

Regardless, we must split the input into individual paths. I'm operating under
the assumption that I will be using the input() function, which will return the
user's input as a String. Therefore, we will use the split() function. 
Concurrently, we will get rid of any superfluous characters such as apostrophes, 
brackets, commas, and spaces. Therefore, my logic is to demarcate (either implicitly 
or explicitly) different pathnames by the file extension type at the end of each path.
i.e. we identify the 3 characters following the period at the end of the file.


Let's make a file with a single test case that we will expand upon later.
Here's the first:
